# Jetson Nano Interactive Sensor-Based System 

This project was developed as part of the **EEE 313 - Introduction to Embedded Systems** final exam application. It demonstrates an interactive sensor-based system utilizing the **NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit**, integrating motion sensing, LCD display, servo motor control, and visual/audio feedback.

## Purpose of the Application

The goal is to design a multi-component embedded system where:

- A button triggers **LED + RGB LED + Buzzer** activation.
- A **motion sensor** (ultrasonic) detects object proximity and displays the distance on an **LCD screen**.
- A **step motor** (servo) adjusts its position based on the distance measured by the sensor.
- System behavior dynamically responds to real-time sensor data.

This application showcases the integration of sensors, actuators, and display elements in an embedded Linux environment using Python.
